            LSD was widely and popularly handed out by Nazi Brotherhood members. It was formed from the nervous plasma from Jellyfish and distributed using the association "sea"+"weed". It created a form of nervous and soft tissue electrocution by tricking the botanical and medicinal gardening community into taking an oceanic venom, insiting that it was a medicinal oceanic plant supplement. It was a poison that forced the people into a near death experience and then traumatized them with shocking when they tried to imagine their life as it was or would have been. God then administered His healing to them, but if they denied His existance, whether forced or by choice, then they would be healed into a state of catatonia.
